**DSA Practice**

I will be doing my DSA practice problems every day and push them here and try to maintain a healthy streak.

I am starting from tree as I have already completed the topics before and will go through them afterward if time allows.

This is my attempt to practice DSA every single day and land a decent offer

DSA Sheet I am following is the [Striver SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)
